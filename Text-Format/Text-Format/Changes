Revision history for Perl extension Text::Format.

0.53 Fri Jan 28 13:02:01 IST 2011
    - Adopted by Shlomi Fish (while disclaiming all rights).
    - Convert the build system to Module-Build, while adding keywords
    and resources.
    - The archive name is now the more standard Text-Format-0.53.tar.gz.
    - Fix some typos in the documentation.

0.52 Sun Mar 29 11:32:50 1998
    - fixed some warnings that appeared when using hanging indents
      (tagged paragraphs).  Also added tha ability to use a list
      as an argument to new() and config() so you can pass a hash ref or
      a list as long as the list length is mod 2 == 0

0.51 Tue Feb 24 13:32:22 1998
    - no real bug fix, just the MANIFEST was wrong, also I got a test
      script for testing the justify feature from the guy who originally
      wrote the code for justify

0.50 Sat Feb 21 10:19:33 1998
    - there were no bugs but I figured that the new feature should
      really have its own release.  I also tried to make the
      justification a little faster, and the extra spaces are now added
      starting on the right side of the text instead of the left
    - fixed up the docs a little as well

0.46 Wed Feb 18 17:19:43 1998
    - fixed bug in justify when there was only one word left for the
      last line it would consider the previous line to be the last line
      and not justify it. :-(

0.45 Wed Feb 18 00:04:01 1998
    - changed the way hanging indents behave when there are more
      paragraphs than indent tags, previously the first tag was reused,
      now an empty text is used if there are no more tags available.
    - added the justify feature, this will jsutify the text to both
      margins, the rightAlign feture would jusstify to the rigght margin
      and default is to justify to the left margin.  if rightAlign or
      rightFill are set then justify is ignored.  rightFill fills the
      right side with spaces

0.44 Thu Feb 12 16:31:08 1998
    - added quotes to hash keys as 5.003 didn't like unquoted hash keys
      starting with an underscore

0.43 Sat Feb  7 14:55:39 1998
    - fixed some warnings that were occurring

0.42 Fri Feb  6 18:37:13 1998
    - no real changes as far as the user is concerned
    - changed some internal subroutines from being just a reference to
      being a real subroutine so Objects that inherit from Text::Format
      can use them

0.41  Mon Feb  2 22:57:33 1998
    - fixed non-breaking space bug
    - added some more error checking to new() and config()

0.40  Thu Jan 29 16:47:41 1998
    - added support for non-breaking space
    - made some changes that make the module incompatible with the
      previous version
      * firstIndent and bodyIndent now take a number as an argument and
        spaces are used for the indents at all times rather than the
        previously specified strings
      * expandTabs is gone - to expand tabs prior to using center()
        just use Text::Format->expand() first
      * subroutines wrap and fill renamed to format() and paragraphs()
        to reflect their usage
    - fixed the bug due to the right margin not being considered when
      doing right alignment

0.33  Wed Jan 21 17:50:39 1998
    - added left margin and right margin spec, left out by accident
      before

0.32  Sat Jan 17 11:45:48 1998
    - fixed another bug :-(

0.31  Fri Jan 16 17:23:18 1998
    - renamed module to Format.pm (was Manip.pm)
      fixed a warning; was operating on an undef'ed string without
      checking now check for defined strings

0.30  Wed Jan 14 22:20:37 1998
    - added ability to do hanging indents, fixed the interface for a
      better object oriented design, fixed some more bugs

0.23  Fri Jan 10 22:56:40 1998
    - few bug fixes

0.22  Fri Jan 10 17:39:23 1998
    - addition of expand/unexpand routines

0.21  Thu Jan  9 20:23:34 1998
    - addition of center routine

0.20  Wed Jan  8 22:20:28 1998
    - change to object oriented module

0.10  Tue Jan  6 15:28:29 1998
    - original version
      routines are : wrap, fill
      basically the same as Text::Wrap at this point just without the
      chance for dying, it's just a basic module - Andreas Koenig
      suggested to make it object oriented
