=head1 NAME

Dist::Man - a simple starter kit for any module

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.0.2';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Nothing in here is meant for public consumption.  Use F<pl-dist-man>
from the command line.

    pl-dist-man create --module=Foo::Bar,Foo::Bat \
        --author="Andy Lester" --email=andy@petdance.com

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the core module for Dist::Man.  If you're not looking to extend
or alter the behavior of this module, you probably want to look at
L<pl-dist-man> instead.

Dist::Man is used to create a skeletal CPAN distribution, including basic
builder scripts, tests, documentation, and module code.  This is done through
just one method, C<create_distro>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Dist::Man->create_distro(%args)

C<create_distro> is the only method you should need to use from outside this
module; all the other methods are called internally by this one.

This method creates orchestrates all the work; it creates distribution and
populates it with the all the requires files.

It takes a hash of params, as follows:

    distro  => $distroname,      # distribution name (defaults to first module)
    modules => [ module names ], # modules to create in distro
    dir     => $dirname,         # directory in which to build distro
    builder => 'Module::Build',  # defaults to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
                                 # or specify more than one builder in an
                                 # arrayref

    license => $license,  # type of license; defaults to 'perl'
    author  => $author,   # author's full name (required)
    email   => $email,    # author's email address (required)

    verbose => $verbose,  # bool: print progress messages; defaults to 0
    force   => $force     # bool: overwrite existing files; defaults to 0

=head1 PLUGINS

Dist::Man itself doesn't actually do anything.  It must load plugins that
implement C<create_distro> and other methods.  This is done by the class's C<import>
routine, which accepts a list of plugins to be loaded, in order.

For more information, refer to L<Dist::Man::Plugin>.

sub import {
    my $class = shift;
    my @plugins = ((@_ ? @_ : 'Dist::Man::Simple'), $class);
    my $parent;

    while (my $child = shift @plugins) {
        eval "require $child";

        croak "couldn't load plugin $child: $@" if $@;

        ## no critic
        no strict 'refs'; #Violates ProhibitNoStrict
        push @{"${child}::ISA"}, $parent if $parent;
        use strict 'refs';
        ## use critic

        if ( @plugins && $child->can('load_plugins') ) {
            $parent->load_plugins(@plugins);
            last;
        }
        $parent = $child;
    }

    return;
}
